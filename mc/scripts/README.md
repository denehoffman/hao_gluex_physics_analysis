 # Usage: 
 ```sh
$ ./job_submission.sh 
 ```
# Features
 The program takes MC_GEN's def file as general input, while sample size and number of samples can be set up directly in the job_submission file. The output files include the ascii file generated by mc_gen, dana_rest file from hd_root and skims from reaction filters.
 
# Simulation Procedure
The run_job_cluster.csh will run through all simulation steps automatically.
